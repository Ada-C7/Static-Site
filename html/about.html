        <p>The first time I used a computer was when I played Oregon Trail on a school Macintosh. It left such an impression. I often got into books about adventures but it was engaging on a whole different level! As a wagon leader, I had to make critical decisions (like whether or not to ford the river). I played the game over and over trying to figure out the best way to make that imaginary trek.</p>
        <br />
        <p>In 2011, I took the actual journey out West to Seattle. I fell in love with the beauty of the Pacific Northwest and feel consistently inspired by its innovative people. Through meeting software developers and being in a city of Tech giants, I learned what programmers actually do. Through their work so much of our world has changed and will continue to change. I want to be a part of that adventure.</p>
