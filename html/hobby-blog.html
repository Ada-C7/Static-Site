          <p>
            I was first introduced to Lindy Hop in 2009, the very end of my Sophmore year in high school. After seeing my first competition, I was hooked. I have been dancing competitively for the last three years. Along side swing dancing, I am also a member of Sister Kate Dance Company which is an all girls dance troup who specialize in vernacular jazz dancing. In the video to the left, I was included in an open source type dance project. Sasha and Idalia chorographed the piece and created break down videos so that other people could learn the choreography easier if they so wish.

          <h4>Dogs &hearts;</h4>
          <p>
            Dogs have been a part of my whole life. My dad always trained our family dogs to be suitible hunting dogs. This his dog training influence, I have always had a passion towards training and caring for dogs. This has lead me to be the neighborhood dog walker ever since I was in middle school. I currently walk dogs as a side job along with caring for other animals. Pictured above is the newest adition to my family, Stella Bear.
