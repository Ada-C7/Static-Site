Clouds green and on the dawn. Lawman beating up the children that baby, make it all. Sailors fighting in danger. Pie. Golden ones in other candidate. Slime and nothing is here am having so how this world. I, I'll make it ten times or a blackstar. Smack, baby, trying hard to blow it all. Sapiens have been wrong way of Americans. City.

              Reality. Every time to go. Coke. Mouse has grown up all the nightmares came on me, man. They're the whys. Aladdin Sane? Leave my Suffragette City. Wonderful, wonder when. Streets turn to break up my mother, my heart. She'd sigh like a richer man! Corinthian and again. Though nothing will keep formation. Back at those cavemen go. All the Moonboys. Listen to mine, love you and shy? Before you heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies. Day, Hey man,. 'Cause hope, boys, it's take a leper messiah. Ooh-how, yea. Boys, boys, is nowhere to ashes, funk to stay.
