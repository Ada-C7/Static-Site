        QUEEN
      </h2>
      <p class="text" id="queen">
        There is only one queen bee in each hive. She may live up to  3 years, depending on the species. Many beekeepers will locate and mark the queen with a colorful dot or a number on her back to easily identify her among her loyal subjects.
      </p>

      <h2 class="bar">
        WORKER
      </h2>
      <p id="worker" class="text">
        It's likely that every bee you've ever seen was a worker, unless you have looked inside a hive. The workers are all female, and are responsible for hive maintenance, insulation, and construction, and foraging for nectar, pollen, and water.
      </p>

      <h2 class="bar">
        DRONE
      </h2>
      <p id="drone" class="text">
        There are never very many drones in a hive. They don't do any work other than mating with the queen, and don't live very long. They are a bit bigger than the workers, but smaller than the queen.
      </p>

      <h2 class="bar">
        COMB
      </h2>
      <p id="comb" class="text">
        Worker bees create the honeycomb that is then used to store eggs, larvae, pollen, nectar, and honey. You can eat the honeycomb whole or get the honey out with a centrifuge or manual crushing. Beeswax is stuck to natural surfaces (like trees and culverts) with a resin-like substance produced by worker bees called propolis.
      </p>

      <h2 class="bar">
        POLLEN
      </h2>
      <p id="pollen" class="text">
        Worker bees collect pollen from plants while they are gathering nectar. Their legs act like little pollen baskets because the fine hairs catch and hold the pollen grains. The pollen forms small pellets in the comb and is used for allergy treatments and boosting immune functioning.
      </p>

      <h2 class="bar">
        HONEY
      </h2>
      <p id="honey" class="text">
        Honey is a wonderful substance that is a natural preservative, antifungal, antibacterial, and a natural source of sugar.
      </p>

      <h2 class="bar">
        POLLINATION
      </h2>
      <p id="pollination" class="text">
        Many world-wide food crops depend on bees for pollination. When bees go out to forage for food, they only visit one type of plant per trip. As bees visit different plants to get nectar, they pick up and drop off pollen at each plant they visit, pollinating the plants.
