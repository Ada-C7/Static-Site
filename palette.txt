QUESTIONS:::::
-what is up with the auto margin feature as a centering device?
-i want for the three images on the index page to have the images disappear or appear on hover; also want these boxes to be clickable links, so can't click on a disappeared image
-going crazy not being able to center the titles for these three boxes - anywhere would be cool, above, below, inside, just centered!
