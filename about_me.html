            My first career was in veterinary nursing. I cared for patients in
            the ER/ICU for nearly 7 years. After, I pursued my Associates in
            Accounting and worked as a bookkeeper for several years.

            It was after some encouragement from my partner that I began researching
            a career in software engineering. In the Fall of 2016, I was given the
            opportunity of a lifetime, and was admitted to the program at Ada.

            In my spare time (which is nearly nonexistent these days!), I enjoy
            hiking, playing PC games, and painting. I consider myself a lifelong
            learner and thoroughly enjoy watching documentaries and researching
            new or unfamiliar subjects.
