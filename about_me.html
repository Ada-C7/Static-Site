        <p>
          My first career was in veterinary nursing. I cared for patients in
          the ER/ICU for nearly 7 years. After, I pursued my Associates in
          Accounting and worked as a bookkeeper for several years.

          It was after some encouragement from my partner that I began researching
          a career in software engineering. In the Fall of 2016, I was given the
          opportunity of a lifetime, and was admitted to the program at Ada.

        <p>
          In my spare time (which is nearly nonexistent these days!), I enjoy
          hiking, playing PC games, and painting. I consider myself a lifelong
          learner and thoroughly enjoy watching documentaries and researching
          new or unfamiliar subjects.
