          I am keeping this blog of my adventures in software development as a Cohort 7 Adie at Ada Developers Academy.

          I know during my application process I returned time and time again to read the blogs and watch the videos posted by past cohort members as a source of inspiration and encouragement.

          Also someday in the future it will be nice to look back and review my learning and growth process, because only three weeks in it has become abundantly clear there will be plenty of both!

          For anyone considering applying to Ada, hit me up, ask questions! Knowledge is power.

          There is a phenomenon in tech that I call "the tech language creep." It is when tech language begins to creep into your everyday language. It happens to all of us sooner or later.

          An instructor of mine commented recently she has begun automatically typing "git" rather than "get" in emails (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git for context).

          Well, dear reader, it has begun.

          If you already know what an instance is you can skip to the last paragraph. If not, read the next paragraph.

          Here is my quick and dirty explanation of the term instance as it relates to code. First we have what is called a class.  Let's say we make a class named "Book."  All Books have-a title, author, editor, pages, stuff like that. An instance of the Book class would be To Kill a Mockingbird, because To Kill a Mockingbird is-a Book. Each instance would inherit the attributes from the Book class, but have their own unique attributes as well. We can also edit one instance of the class, without affecting the rest. For example, we could change "Red Fish, Blue Fish" into "Green Fish, Blue Fish." That only changes this one instance of book, not all books, right? Makes sense. Ok, now on to the story.

          This morning I was bemoaning to my partner the fact that my last Ada newsletter went to my spam folder which caused me to missed a couple local tech events.  I removed the spam label and said "Ok, but that only makes this instance of email not spam! How do I fix that?" Then I laughed at my self and he looked at me like I was crazy.

          This week we are learning HTML and CSS. This website you are currently visiting is a project to cap our week of study.
          It is of course a static site and I assume we will learn about dynamic sites in the near future. Thus far I am rather enjoying
          the project. I find CSS to be a multilayered (ha) puzzle. I am feeling pretty good about it all in all. I seem to be taking to the
          new information well.  We will see of course when it comes time to get feedback from our instructors. I think the thing I have struggles
          with most has been coming up with the content. Also I don't have a lot of confidence in my ability to design the asthetics of the website.
          Once those are done though, I have had a great time with the layout! I actualy made to complete sets of css for the same html so
          I can switch the look of my website rather easily. What I am most plased with: using several different techniques like a fixed side bar with scrolling
          text boxes, some parallax scrolling, grid layout, and some cool hever stuff. I am also happy about being able to ge the header
          and nav bar exactly the same on every page (which is tougher than it might seem).  What I would like to improve on, hmm, feeling like I have a better
          understanding of a good amount and style of semantics. I think I erred on the side of too much rather than too little. Also I am feeling like some of my
          CSS may be unnecessary as it may be inhereted qualitied, but I am not 100% sure. I went through and commented out lines and if there was no change, deleted them.
          I also looked at the developer tools in chrome and checked where qualities were coming from. Hopefully I cleared that up quite a bit. Pretty sure my
          instructors will let me know.
