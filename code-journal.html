          I am keeping this blog of my adventures in software development as a Cohort 7 Adie at Ada Developers Academy.

          I know during my application process I returned time and time again to read the blogs and watch the videos posted by past cohort members as a source of inspiration and encouragement.

          Also someday in the future it will be nice to look back and review my learning and growth process, because only three weeks in it has become abundantly clear there will be plenty of both!

          For anyone considering applying to Ada, hit me up, ask questions! Knowledge is power.

          There is a phenomenon in tech that I call "the tech language creep." It is when tech language begins to creep into your everyday language. It happens to all of us sooner or later.

          An instructor of mine commented recently she has begun automatically typing "git" rather than "get" in emails (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git for context).

          Well, dear reader, it has begun.

          If you already know what an instance is you can skip to the last paragraph. If not, read the next paragraph.

          Here is my quick and dirty explanation of the term instance as it relates to code. First we have what is called a class.  Let's say we make a class named "Book."  All Books have-a title, author, editor, pages, stuff like that. An instance of the Book class would be To Kill a Mockingbird, because To Kill a Mockingbird is-a Book. Each instance would inherit the attributes from the Book class, but have their own unique attributes as well. We can also edit one instance of the class, without affecting the rest. For example, we could change "Red Fish, Blue Fish" into "Green Fish, Blue Fish." That only changes this one instance of book, not all books, right? Makes sense. Ok, now on to the story.

          This morning I was bemoaning to my partner the fact that my last Ada newsletter went to my spam folder which caused me to missed a couple local tech events.  I removed the spam label and said "Ok, but that only makes this instance of email not spam! How do I fix that?" Then I laughed at my self and he looked at me like I was crazy.
