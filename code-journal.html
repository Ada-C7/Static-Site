            <h3> Just be happy. </h3>
            <p>
              All you have to learn here is how to have fun. There we go. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet.
              <br><br>
              La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Use your imagination, let it go. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out.

            <h3> Use your imagination! </h3>
            <p>
              With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it.

              Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue

            <h3> La- da- da- da- dah. </h3>
            <p>
              I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends.
              <br><br>
              If you hypnotize it, it will go away. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.
              <br><br>
              Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. This is unplanned it really just happens. Use what you see, don't plan it. We can fix anything.

            <h3> Let it go. Take your time. </h3>
            <p>
              Use your imagination, let it go. Take your time. Speed will come later. A little happy sunlight shining through there. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book.
              <br><br>
              We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying.
