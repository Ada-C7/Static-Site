          <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
          <p> I was born and raised in a small city close to Bogotá, Colombia called Villavicencio. Villavicencio is situated at the base of the Andes mountains where the llanos (plains) sprawl before they reach the Amazon rain forest. The llanos is cowboy country so I grew up riding horses and exploring the countryside. After graduating high school I moved to Bogotá to attend the National University of Colombia. At university studied physics with an emphasis on optics. Shortly before graduating University, I met the love of my life; a Colombian-American aviation geek. After graduation I moved to the United States to be with my now husband. I spent the next two years of my life traveling around the U.S. and the world for my husbands job at Boeing. We settled back down in Seattle last summer and now I am honored to be participating in the Ada Developers Academy to realize my goal of being a kick-ass programmer.

          <h4>PASSIONS</h4>
          <p>I would summarize my passions as food, traveling, social justice and animals. I grew up in a family of great cooks and married into a family of extreme foodies! This means planning breakfast while eating dinner :) Part of the reason I love traveling so much is to explore different cuisines! I have been fortunate to travel the world with my husband and it has opened my eyes to the beauty of experiencing new cultures. With every trip I take, the more I realize how amazing this world is and makes me want to see more and more. At the same time, traveling also has enlightened me to the struggles faced by people around the world. As someone that grew up in Colombia, I am no stranger to social injustices. I hope to use the education and skills I have been fortunate enough to obtain to help make a difference in the world around me. I suppose this passion to help originates from my longstanding love of animals. As a child in a small city in Colombia, there were so many street dogs. I would take in as many as my family could handle and make sure to feed and care for any that I encountered.

          <h4>HOBBIES</h4>
          <p>I love to dance and listen to live music. I love all kinds of dancing and especially salsa (not the kind with chips, but I do like that too). Dancing is a physical and mental relief from any stress in my life. Some people do things like mediation and yoga, for me there is nothing more peaceful than moving by body to the rhythm of the music. While you can find me dancing in my sweatpants at home, nothing beats the energy of dancing at a live concert. When I am not dancing or listening to music, I like to explore nature with my husband when the weather is nice. For the cold, rainy Seattle days you can find me snuggled up watching silly shows on Netflix.
