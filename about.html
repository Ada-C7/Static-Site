        <h1>Photography</h1>
        <p>
          Kelly, in the time she can find between school and the rest of life, enjoys taking photographs. Her favorite subjects are grand sweeping landscapres, and tiny ordinary things which might
          usually be overlooked. A couple of courses in college on photography and film development lead to a most rewarding hobby. She hopes someday to have her own darkroom and real time to devote to it.

        <h1>Code</h1>
        <p>
          Kelly is currently a student at Ada developers academy in Seattle. She fell in love with code from the first look into the HTML of a website. She tinkered with the code, and loved the power to change what she saw on the screen with a few keystroke. Ada Developers Academy created a bridge into that world.
          The water here is deeper than she had imagined and she loves it.

        <h1>Nature</h1>
        <p>
          Having grown up in small town America, Kelly frequently took refuge from the slings and arrows of life sitting in the fork of a tree with a book in hand. There was a peace in nature not found elsewhere.
          Kelly returns to find that feeling whenever possible.
