          On a perfect day, I know that I can count on you When that's not
          possible Tell me can you weather the storm? 'Cause I need somebody who
          will stand by me Through the good times and bad times She will always,
          always be right there Sunny days, everybody loves them Tell me baby can
          you stand the rain? Storms will come This we know for sure (This we know
          for sure) Can you stand the rain? Love unconditional, I'm not asking
          just of you And girl to make it last I'll do whatever needs to be done
          But I need somebody who will stand by me When it's tough she won't run
          She will always, be right there for me Sunny days, everybody loves them,
          tell me, baby Can you stand the rain? (Can you stand it?)
