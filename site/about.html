        <h1>Me</h1>
        <p> I've grown up and lived in the greater Seattle area all my life.
          I am a student at ADA Developers Academy learning what it takes to
          be a Full Stack Web Developer. Outside of school I like to lift weights,
          hike/backpack, and spend time with family and friends.
