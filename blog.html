          <h4>Podcasts</h4>
          <p>I spend more time than I should listening to podcasts. Below are some of my current favorites.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/anotherround" target="_blank">Another Round with Heben and Tracy</a><p>Heben and Tracy interview so many interesting people and ask such good questions. They get to the point while being funny and sharp. Some highlights for me: #57 (with poet Jenny Zhang), #28 (with Hillary Clinton), and #3 (with Issa Rae, before her show Insecure came on). And a million others I won't list here (Ta-Nehisi Coates! Padma Lakshmi! Melissa Harris-Perry! Janet Mock!)</p></li>
            <li><a href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/all/season-1/" target="_blank">StartUp (Season One)</a><p>Alex Blumberg hosts this podcast which documents his efforts to start a podcast media company. So much great behind-the-scenes detail; the highlights for me were the interactions between Blumberg and his wife Nazanin Rafsanjani. Later seasons document other startups and companies and I did not find them as compelling but continued to listen (*spoiler alert*) so I could hear for updates on Gimlet (the media company Blumberg founded and now runs) One.</p></li>
            <li>More Perfect</li>
            <li>Pop Culture Happy Hour</li>
            <li>The New York Times Daily</li>
