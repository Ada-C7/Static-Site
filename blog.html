      <h3> My Best Friend</h3>
      <p>
        Lynzsea Skye Williams is my best friend in the whole world.  She is an artist and film maker and the most whimsical, creative person I know. She is into “her whole uniqueness” thing and wears skirts over pants.  She hates jumpsuits, African dance, eighties music, and role-playing games. I love her very, very dearly.

      <h3> My Childhood</h3>
      <p>
        One of the great treats in my family was to eat MRE rations.  My dad worked in food supply for the National Guard and every once in awhile he’d get to take home some extras.  We’d store them in the garage, and then on a very, very special day:  MRE’s for lunch!!! I liked the meat (chicken?) that was smushed into a square, and my sister liked the cheese you could squeeze out of a pouch.  We both loved the walnut cake—it was like a pop tart and a slice of fruitcake at the same time. MMMMMMMMMMMM! That's good eatin'!

      <h3> My Bladder</h3>
      <p>
        Once in the third grade, I wet my pants.  We had these jars of rocks on our desks, and if you asked to go to the bathroom, the teacher would take handful of rocks out of your jar.  If you lost all your rocks, you had to sit in front of the student jury and they would give you a “verdict” (always guilty). Then you got a punishment which was usually running laps but sometimes jumping jacks.  I didn't want any of that so I made a bad choice.
