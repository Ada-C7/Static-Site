              I know she's a brownish area! With points! And I love her! Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. Here he comes. Here comes John Wayne.

            Turn this skiff around! It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City. It's sort of like going from prime rib to… I don't know… weird brother of prime rib. Well, yeah you've gotta lock that down.

            I need a fake passport, preferably to France…I like the way they think. And I wouldn't just lie there, if that's what you're thinking. That's not what I WAS thinking. Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good way to think about her, as a backup.

            What, so the guy we are meeting with can't even grow his own hair? COME ON! You don't want a hungry dove down your pants. Either I zip down, or he zips up, and that is a mighty long zipper on Mother's Cher jumpsuit.

              You just made a fool out of yourself in front of T-Bone. "Circumvent." It means "to go around." Gob: The old "reach around." If I wanted something your thumb touched I'd eat the inside of your ear.
