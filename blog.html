            <h4>Podcasts</h4>
            <p>I spend more time than I should listening to podcasts. Below are some of my current favorites. Subscribe to these podcasts through your favorite podcast app (I use the native Podcast iphone app).</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/anotherround" target="_blank">Another Round with Heben and Tracy</a><p>Heben and Tracy interview so many interesting people and ask such good questions. They get to the point while being funny and sharp. Some highlights for me: #57 (with poet Jenny Zhang), #28 (with Hillary Clinton), and #3 (with Issa Rae, before her show Insecure came on). And a million others I won't list here (Ta-Nehisi Coates! Padma Lakshmi! Melissa Harris-Perry! Janet Mock!)</p></li>
              <li><a href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/all/season-1/" target="_blank">StartUp (Season One)</a><p>Alex Blumberg hosts this podcast which documents his efforts to start a podcast media company. So much great behind-the-scenes detail; the highlights for me were the interactions between Blumberg and his wife Nazanin Rafsanjani. Later seasons document other startups and companies and I did not find them as compelling but continued to listen (*spoiler alert*) so I could hear for updates on Gimlet (the media company Blumberg founded and now runs) One.</p></li>
              <li><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/129472378/pop-culture-happy-hour" target="_blank">Pop Culture Happy Hour</a><p>This was I think my gateway podcast.  It's from NPR and a pretty lighthearted but thoughtful review of movies, tv, books, and sometimes music. They have a rotating cast who take turns filling in the fourth seat for their weekly roundtable discussions. Two of my faves are Audie Cornish and Barrie Hardymon </p></li>
              <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/podcasts/the-daily-get-ready-for-the-daily-your-audio-news-report.html">The New York Times Daily</a><p>A daily look at major news events with an in-depth look at one main story. I listen on my commute now</p></li>
