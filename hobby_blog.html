        <h3>Hiking</h3>
        <p>
          Since moving to the PNW, I have discovered a love for hiking. It's not something that is
          common in Florida, and I never realized what a relaxing and therapeutic hobby it is. I am
          by no means an expert, but I've never been on a hike I didn't enjoy.
        </p>

          <a href="http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/navaho-pass" target="_blank">Navaho Pass</a>
          is one of my most memorable hikes. It was very challenging, but totally worthwhile
          (sprained knee and all)!

          is another that I enjoy, mostly due to the fact that I lived close by and was
          able to hike the trail nearly every weekend.

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>
          My introduction to gaming was a bit unorthodox. Thanks to a family friend, I got my first
          computer in 1998. There wasn't a mouse, so I learned how to operate the computer with the
          keyboard alone. There was limited funcationality and I spent most of my time playing SkiFree
          and Rodent's Revenge.

        <p>
          A little while later, we upgraded to a Packard Bell desktop, microphone and all! I recall
          playing a number of games, but cannot recall all of the names. I do recall playing Starcraft,
          Mech Warrior, and Myst.
        </p>

        <p>
          I didn't have access to games for a while after that, but was thoroughly entertained by
          Encarta Encyclopedia! It wasn't until 2010 that I was reintroduced to the gaming, and the
          world of MMORPG's.Since, I have enjoyed games like Lord of the Rings Online, Counterstrike,
          and puzzle games like Portal.
