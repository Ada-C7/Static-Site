        <h3>Hiking</h3>
        <p>
          Since moving to the PNW, I have discovered a love for hiking. It's not something that is
          common in Florida, and I never realized what a relaxing and therapeutic hobby it is. I am
          by no means an expert, but I've never been on a hike I didn't enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Navaho Pass is one of my most memorable hikes. It was very challenging, but totally worthwhile
          (sprained knee and all)!
        </p>

        <p>
          Poo Poo point is another that I enjoy, mostly due to the fact that I lived close by and was
          able to hike the trail nearly every weekend.
        </p>
