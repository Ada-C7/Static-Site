            Since moving to the PNW, I have discovered a love for hiking. It's not something that is
            common in Florida, and I never realized what a relaxing and therapeutic hobby it is. I am
            by no means an expert, but I've never been on a hike I didn't enjoy.

            is one of my most memorable hikes. It was very challenging, but totally worthwhile
            (sprained knee and all)!

            is another that I enjoy, mostly due to the fact that I lived close by and was
            able to hike the trail nearly every weekend.

            My introduction to gaming was a bit unorthodox. Thanks to a family friend, I got my first
            computer in 1998. There wasn't a mouse, so I learned how to operate the computer with the
            keyboard alone. There was limited funcationality and I spent most of my time playing SkiFree
            and Rodent's Revenge.

            A little while later, we upgraded to a Packard Bell desktop, microphone and all! I recall
            playing a number of games, but cannot recall all of the names. I do recall playing Starcraft,
            Mech Warrior, and Myst.
          </p>

          <p>
            I didn't have access to games for a while after that, but was thoroughly entertained by
            Encarta Encyclopedia! It wasn't until 2010 that I was reintroduced to the gaming, and the
            world of MMORPG's.Since, I have enjoyed games like Lord of the Rings Online, Counterstrike,
            and puzzle games like Portal.
