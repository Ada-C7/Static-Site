          Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band Pretty eyed,
          pirate smile, you'll marry a music man Ballerina, you must have
          seen her dancing in the sand And now she's in me, always with me,
          tiny dancer in my hand Jesus freaks out in the street Handing tickets
          out for God Turning back she just laughs The boulevard is not that
          bad Piano man he makes his stand In the auditorium Looking on she
          sings the songs The words she knows, the tune she hums But oh how it
          feels so real Lying here with no one near Only you and you can hear
          me When I say
