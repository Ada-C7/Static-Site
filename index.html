        Thanks for visiting! By now you may know that I am a student at
        <a href="http://adadevelopersacademy.org/" target="_blank">Ada Developer's Academy</a>, preparing
        to be a junior developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        What you may not know is that most of my formal education is in
        Biology and Accounting. It's my non-traditional background that
        gives me a unique world view, and one that I believe will benefit
        the tech industry.
      </p>

      <p>
        Have a look around and drop me a line! If you're shy, you're welcome
        to stalk me on Google.

        My <a href="https://github.com/ChantalRollison/Calculator" target="_blank">
          Calculator</a> project was one of my earliest
          works in Ruby and it was one that allowed us to demonstrate our
          understanding of user interaction and basic arithmetic in ruby.
        </p>

        <p>-
          One of our first pair programming projects was <a href="https://github.com/ChantalRollison/rideshare-rails" target="_blank">Rideshare</a>. It required us to display and manipulate a large amount of data from a CSV file.
        </p>

        <p>-
          <a href="https://github.com/ChantalRollison/rails-zoo" target="_blank">Rails zoo </a> was a rails project that involved us creating an app that allowed users to add/delete animals from our "zoo".

          The <a href="https://github.com/ChantalRollison/api-muncher" target="_blank">API muncher</a>
          project was our first project utilizing an API, and one that I thoroughly enjoyed. Have a look
          and find something new and tasty to cook!
        </p>

        <p>-
          A smaller, and more recent project was called <a href="https://github.com/ChantalRollison/js-digital-clock">JS Digital Clock.</a> We created this during our first week of JavaScript!

          <a href="https://github.com/ChantalRollison/js-scrabble">JS Scrabble</a> was a redo of an older Scrabble project we originally wrote in Ruby.

              Since moving to the PNW, I have discovered a love for hiking. It's not something that is
              common in Florida, and I never realized what a relaxing and therapeutic hobby it is. I am
              by no means an expert, but I've never been on a hike I didn't enjoy.
            </p>

              <a href="http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/navaho-pass" target="_blank">Navaho Pass</a>
              is one of my most memorable hikes. It was very challenging, but totally worthwhile
              (sprained knee and all)!
            </p>

            <p>
              <a href="http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/poo-poo-point" target="_blank">Poo Poo Point</a>
              is another that I enjoy, mostly due to the fact that I lived close by and was
              able to hike the trail nearly every weekend.

              My introduction to gaming was a bit unorthodox. Thanks to a family friend, I got my first
              computer in 1998. There wasn't a mouse, so I learned how to operate the computer with the
              keyboard alone. There was limited funcationality and I spent most of my time playing SkiFree
              and Rodent's Revenge.
            </p>

            <p>
              A little while later, we upgraded to a Packard Bell desktop, microphone and all! I recall
              playing a number of games, but cannot recall all of the names. I do recall playing Starcraft,
              Mech Warrior, and Myst.
            </p>

            <p>
              I didn't have access to games for a while after that, but was thoroughly entertained by
              Encarta Encyclopedia! It wasn't until 2010 that I was reintroduced to the gaming, and the
              world of MMORPG's.Since, I have enjoyed games like Lord of the Rings Online, Counterstrike,
              and puzzle games like Portal.

      My first career was in veterinary nursing. I cared for patients in
      the ER/ICU for nearly 7 years. After, I pursued my Associates in
      Accounting and worked as a bookkeeper for several years.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was after some encouragement from my partner that I began researching
      a career in software engineering. In the Fall of 2016, I was given the
      opportunity of a lifetime, and was admitted to the program at Ada.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my spare time (which is nearly nonexistent these days!), I enjoy
      hiking, playing PC games, and painting. I consider myself a lifelong
      learner and thoroughly enjoy watching documentaries and researching
      neew or unfamiliar subjects.
