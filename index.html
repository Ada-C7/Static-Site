        <div class= "short-bio">
        <p>
          Thanks for visiting! By now you may know that I am a student at
          Ada Developer's Academy, preparing to be a junior developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          What you may not know is that most of my formal education is in
          Biology and Accounting. It's my non-traditional background that
          gives me a unique world view, and one that I believe will benefit
          the tech industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          Have a look around and drop me a line! If you're shy, you're welcome
          to stalk me on Google.
