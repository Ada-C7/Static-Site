          Thanks for visiting! By now you may know that I am a student at
          <a href="http://adadevelopersacademy.org/" target="_blank">Ada Developer's Academy</a>, preparing
          to be a junior developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          What you may not know is that most of my formal education is in
          Biology and Accounting. It's my non-traditional background that
          gives me a unique world view, and one that I believe will benefit
          the tech industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          Have a look around and drop me a line! If you're shy, you're welcome
          to stalk me on Google.
        </p>

          My <a href="https://github.com/ChantalRollison/Calculator" target="_blank">
            Calculator</a> project was one of my earliest
            works in Ruby and it was one that allowed us to demonstrate our
            understanding of user interaction and basic arithmetic in ruby.

            One of our first pair programming projects was <a href="https://github.com/ChantalRollison/rideshare-rails" target="_blank">Rideshare</a>. It required us to display and manipulate a large amount of data from a CSV file.

            The <a href="https://github.com/ChantalRollison/api-muncher" target="_blank">API muncher</a>
            project was our first project utilizing an API, and one that I thoroughly enjoyed. Have a look
            and find something new and tasty to cook!

            A smaller, and more recent project was called <a href="https://github.com/ChantalRollison/js-digital-clock">JS Digital Clock.</a> We created this during our first week of JavaScript!

            My capstone project, <a href="https://github.com/ChantalRollison/capstone-animal">ER Vet</a> , is an app that allows someone to enter basic information about a critical patient into a short form that, once submitted, will calculate emergency drugs/supplies, and display it on the treatment board in the back. It is my hope that this will help reduce the amount of errors from information transfer, and hopefully increase the chances of survival for the patient.

              Since moving to the PNW, I have discovered a love for hiking. It's not something that is
              common in Florida, and I never realized what a relaxing and therapeutic hobby it is. I am
              by no means an expert, but I've never been on a hike I didn't enjoy.

              <a href="http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/navaho-pass" target="_blank">Navaho Pass</a>
              is one of my most memorable hikes. It was very challenging, but totally worthwhile
              (sprained knee and all)!
            </p>

              is another that I enjoy, mostly due to the fact that I lived close by and was
              able to hike the trail nearly every weekend.

              My introduction to gaming was a bit unorthodox. Thanks to a family friend, I got my first
              computer in 1998. There wasn't a mouse, so I learned how to operate the computer with the
              keyboard alone. There was limited funcationality and I spent most of my time playing SkiFree
              and Rodent's Revenge.
            </p>

            <p>
              A little while later, we upgraded to a Packard Bell desktop, microphone and all! I recall
              playing a number of games, but cannot recall all of the names. I do recall playing Starcraft,
              Mech Warrior, and Myst.
            </p>

            <p>
              I didn't have access to games for a while after that, but was thoroughly entertained by
              Encarta Encyclopedia! It wasn't until 2010 that I was reintroduced to the gaming, and the
              world of MMORPG's.Since, I have enjoyed games like Lord of the Rings Online, Counterstrike,
              and puzzle games like Portal.

        My first career was in veterinary nursing. I cared for patients in
        the ER/ICU for nearly a decade. After, I received my Associates in
        Accounting and worked as a bookkeeper for several years.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was after some encouragement from my partner that I began researching
        a career in software engineering. In the Spring of 2017, I was given the
        opportunity of a lifetime, and was admitted to the program at Ada.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my spare time (which is nearly nonexistent these days!), I enjoy
        hiking, playing PC games, and painting. I consider myself a lifelong
        learner and thoroughly enjoy watching documentaries and researching
        new or unfamiliar subjects.
