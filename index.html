      <p>Hi! My name is Natalia and I am the author of this site.
        First of all, the main goal of creating this site is to practice my web-developing skills.
        I currently enroll in coding bootcamp for women called Ada Developers Academy.
        I've created this web site using just HTML and CSS. I tried to make this site more
        responsive and suitable for all kind of devices. My site isn't perfect.There are a lot of details I need to add.
        But I'm trying my best to make it look much better.</p>
        <p>The second reason why I've created this web page, I would like to share projects, that I created while studying at Ada Developers Academy</p>
        <p> I enjoy baking and always dreaming about my persanal cooking blog, that's why I created page, where you
            can find some of my own cooking ideas. </p>
