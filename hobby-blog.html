            <h2>Psycho Killer</h2>
            <p>
              This song and music video was created for Cover Me Badd - a cover band project created by the incredibly talented duo of Anne Trickey and JaMile Jackson.  Music was composed and recorded by Cameron Ford, videography by Morgan Owens, and silly bits written and edited by Lynn.  The song is, of course, Psycho Killer by Talking Heads.  Enjoy!

              Lynn was a part of "There Will be Snacks!" an all-female sketch comedy show.  She and Alison Tafel wrote and performed this lovely number at The Comedy Central Stage in Hollywood.  It's about weddings and love and specialness and bunnies and love and stuff.
