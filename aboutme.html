          I am a civil engineer who worked at an international company, Montgomery Watson Harza, for 6 years. As a design engineer I worked with big data sets, used Access database and GIS software in order to analyze data and build Hydraulic models for water and sewer systems. I was responsible for coordinating project documentation, enforcing quality control procedures, and assisting with various administrative tasks and reports.

          My story with programming started many years ago when I worked as a hydraulic modeler with my company’s developer in the UK for four months in order to test and validate an in-house GIS based wastewater modelling software. I realized that my passion lays not in using software to analyze data, but rather in creating those tools, but the load of work I had back then didn’t leave much time to do coding.

          Years went by and moved to the States to establish my family until 2015 when I was working with my son on a book called “Help Your Kids with Computer Coding”. My son and I were amazed of how by using Python we could design our new game and since then I realized I have to work on my coding skills especially after the decision of pursuing my career.
