          <h3>Ride Share (Mar 2017)</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/add2point71dots/ride-share-two" target="_blank">Ride Share</a> is a Ruby project that reads from CSV files to get information collected from a fictional ride share company and creates Trip, Driver, and Rider objects based on that information. You can call methods on a Trip object to look up the Driver or Rider attached to that Trip, calculate the average rating of a Driver, find out how many Trips a Rider has taken, and more!

          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/jackiewatanabe/Scrabble/" target="_blank">Scrabble</a> is a collaborative Ruby project that builds pieces of code that could eventually fit into a game of Scrabble. It was a practice in test driven design (using minitest) and collaborating with a partner through GitHub. The Scrabble classes are Scoring, Player, and TileBag, which all interact with each other. A Player can draw from a TileBag and play words, which will be scored using Scoring.

          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/add2point71dots/Solar-System" target="_blank">Solar System</a> is a Ruby project built to practice creating classes in Ruby. It's a terminal program that utilizes a Planet class and  SolarSystem class. It asks the user what planet they would like to learn about and then outputs information about that planet. For instance, did you know that Saturn is a gas giant planet that is 72,367 miles in diameter? It's also 795.24 million miles away from Earth. How about that?

          <p>
            <a href="http://addieandtaiyo.com/" target="_blank">addieandtaiyo.com</a> was built as a project for a web design class at Seattle Central Community College.
