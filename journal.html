      <h3>First approach to computers</h3>
      <h6>3/19/17</h6>
      <p> My first exposure to coding was not ideal for two reasons. First, I was insecure about my computer skills. While I was great at science and math, I always had a belief that computers and me didn't get along. Secondly, I was insecure about failing in front of my male peers. During my time in university there were only men in the computer research groups. Even though I worked hard to be one of only two women out of sixty students in the physics department, I still had insecurities and was genuinely scared of failing in front of my male peers. When I finally got the courage to expose myself to some coding and programing, it was not as hard as I initially thought. After several of my former physicist classmates started coding careers, I started to look for opportunities.  Fortunately I found Ada via the web. The first time I applied, I wasn't accepted. While I was disappointed at the time, in hindsight I came to realize I didn't adequately prepare for the application. The next time I applied I spent more than 3 months preparing. It was way more effort than I initially anticipated and it was totally worth every minute! I was accepted to Cohort 7 last November and I am thankful every day for the opportunity.

      <h3> First month in ADA </h3>
      <h6>3/19/17</h6>
      <p>After months of nervous anticipation, I finally started the program. The first several days of the program were fairly relaxed as we went through introductions. The relaxation was short lived as the assignment and course work mounted quickly. I knew going into the program it was going to be a major time commitment considering it was 40+ hours a week of course and home work. The home work has been most consuming element to the program so far. Each evening I am spending around 3-6 hours on my assignments plus an additional 8-10 hours on the weekend. In no way am I complaining. It's truly a shock to the system since I haven't had an intense schedule like this since working on my research project in University. Even then it wasn't as tough since it was my research project was things that I had a solid understanding of. The Ada curriculum is stretching me mentally and it can be exhausting. However, there is hardly any feeling greater than when I see the results of my code come to life.
