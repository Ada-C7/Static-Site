      <h3>First approach to computers</h3>
      <h6>3/19/17</h6>
      <p> During my time in university, I did not have the opportunity to join any reasearch groups computer realated. Only guys were in these groups beacuse, even being one of two women out of 60 students in the physics department, still too hard for me to go over the insecurities that this might invoke in me.
        When finally I got the courage to expose myself to some coding and proggraming, it did not look as hard as I thought was going to be.
        Finally I started to look out for opportunities and found ADA. It was a 2-3 months preparation for the application. It worthed it!
